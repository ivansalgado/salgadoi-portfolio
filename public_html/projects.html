            <h2>Creating A Web Site</h2>
            <!--description about my experience-->
            <p>I am currently working on creating a web site. I am able to do 
               this using <a href="technology.html"> HTML and CSS</a>.</br> 
               These are both what enable me to display what you are 
               seeing on the screen in front of you.</p>
            <p>Although this  project has been enjoyable, there were a lot of 
               moments where I grew </br> frustrated. However, I have learned a lot 
               from the mistakes that I have made and I am now </br> able to correct 
               them more easily. Hopefully, with more projects like this I can 
               attain a </br> higher knowledge of computer programming.</br> </p>
            <p>As you can see below, my portfolio has changed drastically within a few weeks.</p>
