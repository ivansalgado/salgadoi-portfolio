            <!--brief description about me-->
            <p>I'm a student at the <a href="http://www.theappacademy.us/"> App 
               Academy </a> at Pasadena High School. I am currently 
               learning how to </br> create a web site. It has only been four weeks 
               since school started and I have already learned </br> from so much from
               both examples and mistakes! I am very interested in learning about
               the </br> development of computer/mobile applications. Among many other
               careers, I have </br> considered computer programming as something that
               I'd like to pursue. I believe that this </br> class will teach me all 
               of the right steps to make my aspiration a reality</p>
